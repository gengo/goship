# GoShip

A simple tool for deploying code to servers.

### What it does:

GoShip SSHes into the machines that you list in your `config.yml` file and gets the latest revision from the specified git repository. It then compares that to the latest revision on GitHub and, if they differ, shows a link to the diff as well as a Deploy button. You can then deploy by clicking the button, and will show you the output of the deployment command, as well as save the output, diff, and whether the command succeeded.

### Usage

Export your GitHub API token:

    export GITHUB_API_TOKEN="your-organization-github-token-here"

Create a config.yml file:

```yaml
# The user that will SSH into the servers to get the latest git revisions
deploy_user: deployer
projects:
    - my_project:
        project_name: My Project
        repo_owner: github-user
        repo_name: my-project
        environments:
            - staging:
                deploy: /path/to/deployscripts/myproj_staging.sh
                repo_path: /path/to/myproject/.git
                hosts:
                    - staging.myproject.com
                branch: code_freeze
            - production:
                deploy: /path/to/deployscripts/myproj_live.sh
                repo_path: /path/to/myproject/.git
                hosts:
                    - prod-01.myproject.com
                    - prod-02.myproject.com
                branch: master
```

Then run the server manually

```convert id_rsa to pem
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -outform pem > id_rsa.pem
```

```shell
go run goship.go -b localhost:8888 -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem
```

Available command line flags for the `go run goship.go` command are:

```
 -b [bind address]  Address to bind (default localhost:8000)
 -c [config file]   Config file (default ./config.yml)
 -k [id_rsa key]    Path to private SSH key for connecting to Github (default id_rsa)
 -d [data path]     Path to data directory (default ./data/)
```

### Chat Notifications
To notify a chat room when the Deploy button is pushed, create a script that takes a message as an argument and sends the message to the room, and then add it to the config like so:

```yaml
notify: ./notifications/notify.sh
```
